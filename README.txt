Report Used:
    The report I used for A3f takes in a specific user and identifies how many appointments that user has created. This could be useful to see which user is getting the mose use out of the application. This does NOT mean the user was assigned to that appointment. It only means the user is listed as the
    CREATED_BY user column in the database.
